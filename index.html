      <p class="description">What’s IELTS?</p>
      <p class="descriptionAns">
        The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) is designed to
        help you work, study or migrate to a country where English is the native
        language. This includes countries such as Australia, Canada, New
        Zealand, the UK and USA. Your ability to listen, read, write and speak
        in English will be assessed during the test. IELTS is graded on a scale
        of 1-9. IELTS is jointly owned by the British Council, IDP: IELTS
        Australia and Cambridge English.
      </p>
      <p class="description">Why take IELTS?</p>
      <p class="descriptionAns">
        If you are looking to work, live or study in an English-speaking
        country, then you must be able to demonstrate a high level of English
        language ability. English is the third most spoken language in the
        world, with 379 million speakers worldwide. Being able to communicate in
        the native language of the country you wish to work or study in, has a
        wide range of benefits. It is also essential for job opportunities as
        well as integration into the community. IELTS is the most popular test
        for those looking to migrate to Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the
        UK. It is globally recognised by more than 11,000 employers,
        universities, schools and immigration bodies including 3,400
        institutions in the USA.
      </p>
      <p class="description">What IELTS score do I need?</p>
      <p class="descriptionAns">
        The higher you can score in your IELTS, reflects a better understanding
        and ability to communicate in English. Each immigration body,
        university, workplace or institution will have specific IELTS score
        requirements. The score you need will depend on what you are looking to
        do in the country, i.e work or study.
      </p>
      <p class="description">How IELTS is developed</p>
      <p class="descriptionAns">
        IELTS is developed to provide a fair and accurate assessment of English
        language proficiency. Test questions are developed by language
        specialists from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the USA. The
        test covers four sections: Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking.
        IELTS test content reflects everyday situations. It is unbiased and fair
        to all test takers from all backgrounds.
